# MUSI_Enhancement_TCMR_CNN
Medical Ultrasound Image Speckle Reduction and Resolution Enhancement Using Texture Compensated Multi-Resolution Convolution Neural Network

[simulation1.png] is generated using object mask of a sample image in SOD Dataset [1] using noise profile II (Rayleigh noise variance = 0.1, Gaussian filter standard deviation = 0.7) with resolution profile II (64X64 to 256X256).

A working example on sample BUS image is available as a colab-notebook (see MUSI_Enhancement_TCMR_CNN.ipynb)
