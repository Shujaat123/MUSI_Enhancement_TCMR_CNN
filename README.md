# MUSI_Enhancement_TCMR_CNN
Medical Ultrasound Image Speckle Reduction and Resolution Enhancement Using Texture Compensated Multi-Resolution Convolution Neural Network

[simulation1.png] is generated using simulated phantom using noise profile (Rayleigh noise variance = 0.2, Gaussian filter standard deviation = 0.8) with resolution profile II (64X64 to 256X256).

A working example on sample BUS image is available as a colab-notebook (see MUSI_Enhancement_TCMR_CNN.ipynb)
